Here’s a **clean roadmap** you can follow to build this project step by step. It’s structured in **phases**, each one building on the previous, so you’ll always have something functional to show.

---

## **Phase 1 – Foundation (Core Structure)**

Lay the groundwork for both frontend and backend so you don’t run into issues later.

* **Backend Setup (NestJS)**

  * Set up the project structure with modules for:

    * **Auth** (JWT-based login and registration).
    * **Users** (member profiles, admin roles).
    * **Rides** (ride creation, scheduling, ride history).
  * Configure MongoDB with Prisma
  * Implement role-based access:

    * Ride Admin → Full control,Can create/manage rides, can make members admin
    * Regular Rider → View and register for rides.

* **Frontend Setup**

  * Create a Bootstrap-powered layout with these base pages:

    * Home (landing page with mission & upcoming rides).
    * Login / Register.
    * Dashboard (different views for admins vs riders).
  * Connect the frontend to backend APIs for auth and user management.
  * Set up a basic global state management system (e.g., Redux or Context API).

> **Goal:** A functional platform where members can register, log in, and admins can create rides.

## **Phase 2 – Core Features**

Focus on the essential features that riders will use most often.

* **Ride Scheduling**

  * Admins create rides with details: meeting point, time, route, distance.
  * Riders can view rides and indicate attendance.

* **Notifications & Reminders**

  * Integrate with WhatsApp API or SMS API for automatic reminders.
  * Example: *“Tomorrow’s ride: Meeting point – Stadium, 6:00 AM.”*

* **Ride History**

  * Store past rides with basic stats like attendance and route.

* **UI Polish**

  * Add maps for meeting points using Google Maps API.
  * Improve dashboard design for usability.

> **Goal:** By the end of this phase, the club can fully use the platform for ride planning.

## **Phase 3 – Live Peloton Tracking (Signature Feature)**

This is what makes the platform stand out and directly benefits riders.

* **Backend**

  * Implement Socket.IO or WebSockets to broadcast rider locations in real-time.
  * Secure endpoints so only active ride participants can share or view locations.

* **Frontend**

  * Build a live map screen:

    * Shows peloton position in real-time.
    * Shows checkpoints or meeting points.
  * Include a “Join Ride” button so latecomers can find where the group is.

* **Performance**

  * Optimize location updates to prevent lag or heavy data usage.
  * Consider using geohashing or sending updates at intervals (e.g., every 5 seconds).

> **Goal:** Riders who join late can open the app, see exactly where everyone is, and catch up.

---

## **Phase 4 – NGO Readiness**

Prepare for the club’s official registration and public growth.

* **Donation & Sponsorship Module**

  * Allow online donations through Paystack or Stripe.
  * Create a sponsorship page where businesses can partner with the club.
  * Display sponsors on the homepage.

* **Event Reporting**

  * Admins can generate reports on past events and rides.
  * Export data as PDFs or spreadsheets for official NGO documentation.

* **Volunteer Management**

  * Build a simple form for members or outsiders to sign up for charity or community rides.
  * Include approval workflows for admins.

> **Goal:** Transition the platform into an official public-facing NGO tool.

---

## **Phase 5 – Gamification & Community Engagement**

Add features that keep members coming back and attract more riders.

* **Leaderboards**

  * Track ride stats like total distance or attendance.
  * Award badges for consistency or speed.

* **Photo Gallery**

  * Let members upload photos from rides.
  * Create a media section for public outreach.

* **Social Features**

  
  * Commenting on rides or events.

 **Goal:** Make the platform fun and community-driven, not just functional.
